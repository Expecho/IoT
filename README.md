# IoT

Code running on my home automation IoT devices.

- The [Azure Sphere MT3620](https://www.avnet.com/shop/us/products/avnet-engineering-services/aes-ms-mt3620-sk-g-3074457345636825680/) sends data using its luminosity sensor and barometer.
- The[NodeMCU V3 device](https://www.instructables.com/id/Getting-Started-With-ESP8266LiLon-NodeMCU-V3Flashi/) detects motion using an attached motion sensor
- A [Intel Galileo Gen 2](https://www.arduino.cc/en/ArduinoCertified/IntelGalileoGen2) is used for P1 port readings (gas and electricity consumption)
